## Basic integration

- ### Understand the Branch Key

    - Go to [Account settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/account-settings/app) on the Branch Dashboard
    - `Branch Keys` allow you to interact with your Branch SDKs and create deep links
    - These keys are unique to your Branch app
    - Never expose your `Branch Secret` as it can be maliciously used

        ![image](/img/pages/dashboard/branch-keys.png)

- ### Configure default behavior

    - Set the default behavior for your deep links on [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/link-settings)

    - These values are typically overridden by [Custom link behavior](/pages/links/integrate/#custom-link-behavior) for each deep link

    - ##### iOS

        - Use these settings to control the default behavior of your deep links on iOS

            ![image](/img/pages/dashboard/ios.png)

        - The Apple App Prefix is found within the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle) for your app

    - ##### Android

        - Use these settings to control the default behavior of your deep links on Android

        - Play Store is for published apps, if your app cannot be located or is a local/dev build, please use the Custom URL option

            ![image](/img/pages/dashboard/android.png)

        - Generate a SHA256 Cert Fingerprint
            - Navigate to your `keystore file` (used to build the debug and production version of your APK file before it gets deployed)
            - Run `keytool -list -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore` to generate a fingerprint

            - Example fingerprint `AA:C9:D9:A5:E9:76:3E:51:1B:FB:35:00:06:9B:56:AC:FB:A6:28:CE:F3:D6:65:38:18:E3:9C:63:94:FB:D2:C1` to add to your [Branch Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/link-settings)

    - ##### Desktop

        !!! note "We now support deep linking to Desktop apps such as Spotify and Slack, via URI schemes"
            Our beta Mac OS Desktop SDK is available for testing, so please contact your Branch Account Manager or integrations@branch.io for more information.

        - Use these settings to control the default behavior of your deep links on Desktop browsers

            ![image](/img/pages/dashboard/desktop.png)

        - For Desktop apps
            - Enter your Desktop URI Scheme (e.g. `spotify://`)
            - Include `$desktop_deeplink_path` key-value pair to your link (e.g. `"$desktop_deeplink_path": "track/5D8o9tGf3Dfjz7CgMxcoeI"`)
            - If the app is not installed when the link is clicked, we will fall back to the Desktop or Default URL, in that order
            - This feature is still in the early stages of development; so usage without a Desktop SDK will not be able to attribute or pass data through an install.

    - ##### Fallback
        - Use these settings to control the default behavior of your deep links on any other platform

            ![image](/img/pages/dashboard/fallback.png)

    - ##### Link domain
        - Choose a `link domain` which will be used for all your links
        - The `link domain` is the website which hosts your deep links
        - The `link domain` is not a deep link
            - Deep links have an `alias` behind them to uniquely identify the link data inside them
                - e.g. https://example.app.link/VZsTctoINF
                - e.g. https://example.app.link/custom-alias
        
            ![image](/img/pages/dashboard/link-domain.png)
    
    - ##### Social media 

        - Set the default image preview for your deep links when shared on social media
        - These values are typically overridden by [Custom link behavior](/pages/links/integrate/#custom-link-behavior) which differentiate your deep links between one another

            ![image](/img/pages/dashboard/social-media.png)

    - ##### Save
        - Make sure you commit any changes

            ![image](/img/pages/dashboard/save.png)

- ### Enable a Deepview

    - Go to [Deepview Previews](https://dashboard.branch.io/web/deepviews) on the Branch Dashboard
    - Toggle `Enabled` for `branch_default` for `iOS` and `Android`
    - This will make your deep links perform optimally on all [Supported platforms](/pages/links/integrate/#expected-redirect-behavior)
    - Additional details about [Deepviews](/pages/web/deep-views/)

        ![image](/img/pages/dashboard/deepview.png)

## Advanced integration

- ### Configure user
    - Go to [Account settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/account-settings/user) on the Branch Dashboard
    - Handle your Branch user account with email, password, and user id
    - Connect your Github account to your Branch dashboard for easier sign in

- ### Configure billing
    - Go to [Account settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/account-settings/billing) on the Branch Dashboard
    - Set your billing information for Branch premium features

- ### Configure team
    - Go to [Account settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/account-settings/team) on the Branch Dashboard
    - Add and update team members to your Branch dashboard
        - Set users' [dashboard permissions](/pages/dashboard/access-level)

- ### Change advanced settings
    - Go to [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/link-settings) on the Branch Dashboard
    - Set `Match type` to either `unique` or `normal` (default)
        - Recommended `Normal`. Selecting `Unique` means that Branch will only make a deep link through install match if there is a single, unique outstanding footprint. For example, if you and your twin both have iPhone 5s with the same OS/version, etc and click different links for the same app, then open the app up at the same time, we won’t deep link when Unique is selected. You probably don’t want this as it’s mostly for very special circumstances.
    - Set `Duration` to seconds
        - Duration is how long a `click` will live in our system before it is consumed by either an app `open` or system delete. Modifying this value will change how long we wait to fingerprint a user. If a user is fingerprinted within the set duration, then deep link data will flow into the app. The default the expiration is 2 hours (7200 seconds).
    - Set `UTM tags`
        - Recommend `disabled`. If you enable this, Branch will automatically set channel, feature, campaign, tags and $keywords based on UTM params. This only applies to dynamically created links, not links generated through the Dashboard, API or SDKs.

            | UTM parameter | Branch parameter
            | --- | --- |
            | utm_source | Channel
            | utm_medium | Feature
            | utm_campaign | Campaign
            | utm_content | Tags
            | utm_term | Keywords (not visible on Dashboard)

## Troubleshoot issues

- ### Domain change warning
    - Used for [Change link domain](#change-link-domain)
    - From `app.link` to `app.link`
        - Your old `app.link` deep links will fail
        - Your old `app.link` deep links will navigate to a File Not Found website and not open your app.
        - Your new `app.link` deep links will open your app after you [update your code](#dialog-code?ios=configure-associated-domains&android=configure-app&adobe=configure-app&cordova=configure-app&mparticleAndroid=configure-app&mparticleIos=configure-associated-domains&titanium=configure-app&reactNative=configure-app&unity=configure-app&xamarin=configure-app) to append the new link domain
        - If your old `app.link` are active, it is recommend to switch to a `custom link domain instead`
    - From `app.link` to `custom link domain`
        - Your old `app.link` deep links will still work
        - Your new `custom link domain` deep links will open your app after you [update your code](#dialog-code?ios=configure-associated-domains&android=configure-app&adobe=configure-app&cordova=configure-app&mparticleAndroid=configure-app&mparticleIos=configure-associated-domains&titanium=configure-app&reactNative=configure-app&unity=configure-app&xamarin=configure-app) to append the new link domain
    - From `custom link domain` to `custom link domain`
        - Your old `custom link domain` deep links will fail
        - Your new `custom link domain` deep links will open your app after you [update your code](#dialog-code?ios=configure-associated-domains&android=configure-app&adobe=configure-app&cordova=configure-app&mparticleAndroid=configure-app&mparticleIos=configure-associated-domains&titanium=configure-app&reactNative=configure-app&unity=configure-app&xamarin=configure-app) to append the new link domain
    - From legacy `bnc.lt` to `custom link domain`
        - Both your `bnc.lt` and `custom link domain` deep links will work
        - Your new `custom link domain` deep links will open your app after you [update your code](#dialog-code?ios=configure-associated-domains&android=configure-app&adobe=configure-app&cordova=configure-app&mparticleAndroid=configure-app&mparticleIos=configure-associated-domains&titanium=configure-app&reactNative=configure-app&unity=configure-app&xamarin=configure-app) to append the new link domain

- ### Custom domain warning
    - Used for [Change link domain](#change-link-domain)
    - The `NS` or `CNAME` records of your `custom link domain` will need to point to Branch if you want to use your own domain for your deep links
    - Whenever you change your `NS` or `CNAME` records of a domain, you are making Branch the authoritative registrar for your domain. This will grant Branch control of your domain and you will lose all access to that `custom root domain` or `custom subdomain`. The web page will become blank, and the control of the domain will change to Branch
    - Branch will use your domain to route all deep linked traffic. Branch will also host your AASA file and SSL certificates
    - If you have content on your `custom root domain` (e.g. https://example.com/), Branch recommends using an unused `custom subdomain` instead (e.g. https://link.example.com/)

- ### Custom domain debugging
    - Used for [Change link domain](#change-link-domain)
    - You can test your domain record changes with `dig ns <domain>` or `dig cname <domain>`
    - We recommend that you choose one domain or subdomain to use with Branch and stick with it, as switching can cause significant problems with your existing links
    - If you are configuring the domain through AWS's Route 53, make sure you are editing the nameservers under the `Registered Domains` tab, and not the `Hosted zones` section
    - You cannot use your main website domain for hosting Branch links
    - Do not include `www` when adding your custom link domain
    - If you have CAA records set for your domain, add letsencrypt.org to the list
